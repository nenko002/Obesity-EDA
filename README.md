# üß† Data-Driven Insights on Obesity and Lifestyle Habits

This project explores the relationships between lifestyle factors (e.g., physical activity, diet, alcohol use, smoking) and obesity levels using a real-world dataset. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and correlation analysis.

## Analysis Conducted

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
- Distribution plots (age, weight, physical activity)
- Obesity level frequency and gender breakdown

### Hypothesis Testing
- Smokers vs. non-smokers BMI
- Physical activity vs. BMI


### Correlation Analysis
- Pearson: Age vs. BMI
- Spearman: Exercise vs. Obesity Rank
- Point-Biserial: Healthy Weight vs. FCVC
- Phi: Smoking vs. Calorie Monitoring
- Kendall's Tau: Exercise vs. Sedentary Time
